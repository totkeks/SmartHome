# My Smart Home Setup

This repository contains the configurations, scripts, and documentation for my smart home setup.
By consolidating everything in one place, I have a single source of truth that I can easily maintain, update, and expand.

You are welcome to explore the repository and use the configurations and scripts as inspiration for your own smart home setup.

Contributions are not accepted at this time, but you are welcome to open issues if you have suggestions or encounter any problems.
